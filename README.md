This application mimics the database of a social network API (such as Facebook). It includes models for users, thoughts and reactions and all of these can be created, edited and deleted in Insomnia.

## Usage

Since this database utilizes MongoDB, the database does not have to be created manually as it does with base SQL. Additionaly, no seeds were used for this application. To start the application, simply run the below command in the terminal. Once the server has successfully started, you will see the following message in the terminal: "Server started on port 3000"

To start the application, run the following command in the terminal

        npm start
